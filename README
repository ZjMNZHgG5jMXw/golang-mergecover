mergecover - merge golang cover profiles across multiple packages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
---------------

  $ mergecover outfile infile1 [infile2 ...]

Docker
---------------

  $ docker run wok6fvjui5ur2/mergecover mergecover

Compile
---------------

Install stack from stackage.org or from your favourite package manager.
Then run

  $ stack init
  $ stack install

Description
---------------

At the time of writing this tool, it was not possible with GoLang standard
tools to create a Go coverprofile of multiple packages. With merge cover, you
can merge multiple cover profiles to one that declares a statement as covered,
iff the statement is covered according to one of the cover profiles.

Create profiles for each subprofile like that:

  $ go test --coverpkgs=super... --coverprofile=sub.profile super/sub

Merge the profiles:

  $ mergecover merged.profile *.profile

Review the merged profile:

  $ go tool cover -html=merged.profile

Limitations
---------------

* "mode: set" is the only one supported
* the input cover profiles should be created from one and the same source
* the parser for cover profiles is pretty simple, maybe too simple

Closing remark
---------------

Please report any problems and let me know of GoLang (re-)implementations.
